# learning-SQL

I'm trying to learn SQL and the point of this repository is to hold the SQL statements I write. I also plan on using this repository as a way to hold myself accountable to actually work through exercises.

## Folders

#### learning-SQL-book

The code in this folder comes from <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-sql-3rd/9781492057604/">Learning SQL, 3rd Edition</a>. This will be me coding along with the book and solving the exercises presented in the book.
